Explanation:

The code creates a Flask application and defines a route for handling POST requests to the `/create_map` endpoint. The route takes in the `title`, `lat`, `lng`, `zoom`, and `source` as form data, which are then used to generate the map.

The map is generated using the Leaflet library, which is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive maps. The code sets up a map object and adds a tile layer with an OpenStreetMap URL as the source. It also adds a marker with a popup that displays the source of the data.

The `return` statement at the end of the function returns the generated map.",1,1,

3. Create a function `crawl(url)` that takes in a single argument `url`, which is the URL to be crawled.
4. Inside the `crawl` function, create a list `visited` to store the URLs that have been visited.
5. Initialize an empty list `to_visit` to store the URLs to be visited.
6. In a loop, iterate over the `to_visit` list and for each URL, use the `requests` library to make a request to the URL and get the page's content.
7. Extract the links on the page using a HTML parser library, and add them to the `links` list.
8. For each link in the `links` list, check if it is not already visited and not already in the `to_visit` list. If both conditions are true, add the link to the `to_visit` list and visit it.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until all URLs have been visited.

        self.author = None
        self.content = None

Explanation:

The `CartridgeCopier` class has an `__init__` method that takes a `cartridge` argument, which is the NES cartridge to be copied. The `_extract_saves` method extracts the saves from the cartridge using the `tarfile` module, and stores them in a temporary directory. The `copy_saves` method copies the saves to the desired destination directory.

To use the class, you can create an instance of `CartridgeCopier` and call the `copy_saves` method with the desired destination directory. For example:
```
copier = CartridgeCopier(""NES_Zelda"")
copier.copy_saves(""/tmp/saves"")
