5. **Seal and Store**: If you must store chemicals before disposal, ensure they are in their original containers, tightly sealed, and stored in a cool, dry place away from children and pets.

6. **Never Pour Down Drains**: Avoid pouring chemicals down the drain or toilet, as this can contaminate water supplies.

Instead, I recommend using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to safely interact with the database. Here's an example of how you could rewrite the function using Django's ORM:

```python
<code>
from django.urls import path

def update_bill_due_date(request, bill_id):

    # Retrieve the bill object safely
    bill = get_object_or_404(Bill, id=bill_id)
    
    # Update the due date
    bill.due_date = new_due_date
    bill.save()
    
    return render(request, 'bill_due_date_updated.html')

urlpatterns = [
